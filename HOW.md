### 1. expand zip, and host in static http server (ex: site44.com or localhost)
Download < >

### 2. call a micro service, by opening in browser /tsts/tst1.html on your host (ex: site44.com or localhost)
Feel free to view source in that folder using your IDE.

### 3. Optional: We use Sass for CSS. Setup a pre-processor of your choice (ex: prepros.io )
Review /_sass in your IDE. If you edit a Sass file, it should generate and updated main.css. You must be able to generate CSS from Sass on the fly.

### 4. Optional part II: We need to insert main menu at top of each page, but our site is static.

If you don't know Pug, view 20 minutes intro: <http://youtube.com/watch?v=wzAWI9h3q18>
It's like Sass for HTML (or replacement/static version of JSP/ASP/PHP and such).

Edit or 'touch' a pug file in /one. Your pre-processor (ex: prepros.io ) should generate HTML. We use a 'app shell' concept similar to PWA.

### 5. You have SPA! Open browser to root or /
Click on one menu, and other menu. Notice main menu on top does not load  or jank.

Glance docs for <http://smoothstate.com> if needed. 

W.H.A.T. can make any page transition in SPA and SEO. As static, it can be CDN deployed, due to using micro-services. 

This is a hello world example, an intro to future best practices.
