## WHAT

There's no Struts in WHAT. But now that we got your attention, what is WHAT?
WHAT aims to be a showcase of best practices and approaches for developers and designers
who want to build stunning mobile-first web apps with some of the best technologies
available now. Some may call it a stack. Some may call it a architecture. We simply call it WHAT, the 
World's Hottest App Technologies ;-)

What stack? What framework? WHAT may provide some answers to those 
who look for great designs.

What technologies make our cut? Those that let us be the most
productive and creative. And that we know to be maintainable. And that we expect 
to be future-safe.

Struts was like a kindergarden: we put the shoes here, the jackets over there,
and now we know where to find things. That made it very successful in its time.
We DO aim to follow this great legacy, and propose approaches that make it easy
to design and develop cutting edge web apps.

We welcome scrutiny and feedback from anyone who tries to follow our approaches. 
We also welcome code contributions from seasoned system- and framework software 
engineers and designers.


# Getting started w/ a 'hello world':

### 1. Download, and host in static http server (ex: site44.com or localhost)
Download the www folder here and host.

### 2. call a micro service, by opening in browser /tsts/tst1.html on your host (ex: site44.com or localhost)
Feel free to view source in that folder using your IDE.

### 3. Optional: We use Sass for CSS. Setup a pre-processor of your choice (ex: prepros.io )
Review /_sass in your IDE. If you edit a Sass file, it should generate and updated main.css. You must be able to generate CSS from Sass on the fly.

### 4. Optional part II: We need to insert main menu at top of each page, but our site is static.

If you don't know Pug, view 20 minutes intro: <http://youtube.com/watch?v=wzAWI9h3q18>.
It's like Sass for HTML (or replacement/static version of JSP/ASP/PHP and such).

Edit or 'touch' a pug file in /one folder. Your pre-processor (ex: prepros.io ) should generate HTML. We use a 'app shell' concept similar to PWA.

### 5. You have a static SPA! Open browser to root or /
Click on one menu, and other menu. Notice main menu on top does not load  or jank.

Glance docs for <http://smoothstate.com> if needed. 

W.H.A.T. can make any page transition in SPA and SEO. As static, it can be CDN deployed, due to using micro-services. This is just a hello world example, an intro to futuristic best practices.
